How to Run the Project

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository

First, download the source code from the GitHub repository:

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KetulChhaya/vg.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd vg

2. Open the Project in VS Code

Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

Use the File > Open Folder... option to open the project folder you just downloaded.

3. Install Dependencies

In the VS Code terminal, run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

npm install

This will download and install all the packages specified in the package.json file.

4. Start the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running:

npm start

This will start the application and open it in your default web browser. If it doesnâ€™t open automatically, navigate to:

http://localhost:3000

5. Explore the Application

You can now interact with the application and test its features.

Additional Notes

If you encounter any issues, ensure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed.

If the port 3000 is occupied, the app may ask to run on another port; type Y to confirm.
